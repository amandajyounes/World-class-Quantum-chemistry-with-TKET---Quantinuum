### The Challenge
As stated in the challenge description, LiH is a potential molecule to be used for hydrogen storage in hydrogen fuel cells. Finding the ground state energy of a molecule like LiH allows scientists to determine important properties like reaction rates that will help in applications like hydrogen storage.

The goal of our challenge was to use a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) to find that ground state energy by relying on the variational principle of quantum mechanics and simulating a Hamiltonian on an actual computer with a classical optimizer. We were also asked to use Quantinuum's python TKET package to optimize our quantum circuits and run them on different backends.
